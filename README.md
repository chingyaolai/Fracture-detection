# Fracture-detection
Fracture detection in collaboration with Harold Li and Pierre Gentine
The availability of remote-sensing data is rapidly expanding. New strategies which take advantage of the most recent algorithms and approaches are needed to interpret large remote-sensing data sets. In order to identify fracture locations from satellite imagery across Antarctica, we develop a neural network model for fracture recognition.
