# Fracture-detection
Using neural networks to detect fracture patterns, in collaboration with Harold Li (data scientist at Lyft), Pierre Gentine (professor at Columbia University), Jonathan Kingslake (assistant professor at Columbia University), and Cameron Chen (data scientist at Google)

### Motivation
The availability of remote-sensing data is rapidly expanding. New strategies which take advantage of the most recent algorithms and approaches are needed to interpret large remote-sensing data sets. In order to identify fracture locations from satellite imagery across Antarctica, we develop a neural network model for fracture recognition. Ice fractures result in the collapse of Antartctica ice-shelves, which is expected to destabilize glacier flows into the ocean and accelerate glabal sea-level rise. The outcome of this research will provide a thorough map of fracture distribution across Antarctica, which is important for evaluating the impact of ice fractures on the future sea-level.
